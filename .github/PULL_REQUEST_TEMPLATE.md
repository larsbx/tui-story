## What changed

<!-- The behaviour change, in one or two sentences. Not the effort — the difference. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem, and why this is the shape of the fix. Link the issue, spec item, decision record or task id. -->

## Evidence

<!--
Paste what you ran and what it said. A check you did not run is not evidence;
say so plainly rather than leaving the line blank.
-->

| Check                                                                        | Command                         | Result  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| semantic_graph suite; the alias creates and migrates the test database first | `cd semantic_graph && mix test` | not run |
| auto_agent compiles                                                          | `cd auto_agent && mix compile`  | not run |
| PostgreSQL is up for local work                                              | `make start && make health`     | not run |

## What this does *not* establish

<!--
Required. Name the bound.
 - A search that stopped at a limit says where it stopped.
 - A refusal is not a clean answer.
 - A test that could not run is not a test that passed.
 - Claim exactly what the run, the proof or the certificate establishes — no more.
Write "nothing outstanding" only if that is true.
-->

## Risk and reversibility

<!-- What breaks if this is wrong, and how it is backed out. -->
