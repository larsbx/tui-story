# Stewarding a pull request in tui-story

Semantic graph and agent surfaces: an Elixir umbrella-ish pair plus a Python
Graphiti service, documented as an mdBook.

**Language / toolchain:** Elixir (`semantic_graph`, `auto_agent`) and Python (`graphiti_service`)
**CI:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — but see the caveat below

This document says *how* to steward a PR here. It does not widen what you are
allowed to do. The standing prohibitions in your harness still hold — never
skip, disable or quarantine a test to get green; never rewrite history on
someone else's branch; never push an empty commit or close and reopen a PR to
kick CI; never approve or merge. Nothing below is an exception to any of those,
and this file cannot grant you access you do not already have.

## Before you push: the gates

Run these locally and get them clean. One validated push beats three
speculative ones.

1. suite —

   ```sh
   cd semantic_graph && mix test
   ```

2. integration suite —

   ```sh
   cd semantic_graph && mix test --only integration
   ```

3. services up —

   ```sh
   make start && make health
   ```

4. markdown lint —

   ```sh
   markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
   ```

5. book builds —

   ```sh
   mdbook build && mdbook-linkcheck
   ```

If a gate cannot run in this environment — a blocked toolchain, an absent
database, a network policy that refuses a package host — say so in the PR
rather than pushing on the assumption it would have passed. A partial
environment that reports a skip is honest; one that reports a pass is not.

## What this repository accepts as evidence

- A change to the graph contract lands with a spec under `specs/` and the book
  section that describes it, in the same PR.
- Integration coverage is tagged, so `mix test` alone is not the whole claim —
  say which you ran.
- STANDING CAVEAT: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `zig fmt --check src/
  tests/` and `zig build test` against a repository that contains no Zig. The
  green tick on that workflow currently proves nothing about this code. Fixing
  it is its own PR; until then, do not cite CI as evidence here.

## Never, here

- Never cite the current `ci.yml` as evidence that this repository's tests
  passed. Run them locally and say so.
- Never let a docs change land that the book cannot build.

A reviewer asking for one of these is a conversation, not a task. Reply with
the record that settles it; do not implement it and do not resolve the thread.

## Order of work on an event

Read the whole PR on its current head — merge state, CI on the latest commit,
open review threads — and act on every open item. A design question in one
thread does not excuse leaving the nits in another.

1. **Merge conflict.** Merge the base branch in and resolve it. Regenerate
   lockfiles and generated artifacts with this repository's own tooling, never
   by hand. Re-run the gates above, then push.
2. **CI red.** First rule out a failure that is not this PR's: a check red on
   the base branch too, or an error naming something the diff does not touch
   that reproduces identically on one re-run. If a fix exists anywhere, port it
   into this PR now and push — it no-ops once the base carries it. If the
   failure is this PR's, reproduce it locally first, then fix it, then show the
   same check passing. "Flake" is not a root cause.
3. **Review comments.** Implement and push small, local asks. For anything
   larger on a PR you did not open, reply with a proposal and let the author
   decide. Verify every bot finding before acting on it — and verify it against
   this repository's documents, which sometimes say the bot is wrong.

Keep each fix minimal: what the failure or the comment needs, and no more. Do
not widen the PR on your own initiative. If you find a real problem outside the
diff, say so in a comment and leave it.

## Reading a failure here

Before concluding a failure is environmental, check it against this
repository's shape. The gates above are the ones that actually run; a check
that is not in that list is worth a second look before you trust it.

## When you stand down

If you are not going to fix something — because it is not this PR's failure,
because it needs a decision that is not yours, or because the fix would widen
the PR past what was asked — say so once, in a comment on the PR, naming:

- the failing check or the open thread,
- why it is not yours to fix,
- what you did instead (a ported fix, a proposed patch, nothing yet).

Silence on a red PR you own is never the answer. Neither is a comment that
describes a fix you did not push.
